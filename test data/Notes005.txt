Notes
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability, making it beginner-friendly.

It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

It has a vast standard library and numerous third-party libraries, making it versatile for tasks like web development, data analysis, machine learning, and automation.

Python uses dynamic typing, meaning variables do not require explicit declaration of their data types.

Its indentation-based syntax enforces code readability and eliminates the need for braces or keywords to define code blocks.

Python has two major versions: Python 2 (now deprecated) and Python 3, which is the current version actively maintained and developed.

It is widely used in fields such as data science, artificial intelligence, web development, scientific computing, and scripting.

Python has a large and active community that provides extensive support, documentation, and resources for developers.

Popular frameworks and libraries like Django, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib extend Python's functionality for specialized tasks.
