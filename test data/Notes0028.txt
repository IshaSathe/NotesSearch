Linear Lines

Notes
A linear line represents a relationship between two variables with a constant rate of change and is described by the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

The slope (m) of a linear line determines its steepness and direction; a positive slope means the line rises as x increases, while a negative slope means it falls.

The y-intercept (b) is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, representing the value of y when x is zero.

Linear lines have a constant slope, meaning the rate of change between any two points on the line remains the same.

Parallel linear lines have the same slope, while perpendicular linear lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other.
