Notes
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995.

Java is platform-independent, meaning programs written in Java can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) using the principle "write once, run anywhere."

Java uses a syntax similar to C++ but simplifies many complex features, making it easier for developers to write robust applications.

Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which the JVM interprets, allowing it to run on different platforms.

Java is widely used for developing web applications, mobile apps (particularly Android), desktop software, and enterprise-level applications.

Java provides automatic memory management with garbage collection, which helps prevent memory leaks by reclaiming unused memory.

Java has a rich standard library known as the Java API, which includes tools for networking, database access, graphical user interfaces, and more.

Java supports multithreading, allowing programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously for better performance in complex applications.

Java is backward-compatible, meaning newer versions of the language usually support code written in older versions.

Popular frameworks and tools built on Java include Spring, Hibernate, Apache Tomcat, and the Android SDK, making it versatile and essential in software development.
