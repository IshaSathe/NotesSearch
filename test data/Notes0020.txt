Notes
Integrals are a fundamental concept in calculus used to calculate areas under curves, accumulated quantities, and antiderivatives.

There are two main types of integrals: definite integrals, which calculate a specific numerical value over an interval, and indefinite integrals, which represent a family of functions.

The definite integral of a function over an interval [a, b] is denoted as âˆ«[a to b] f(x) dx and can be interpreted as the signed area between the curve and the x-axis.

The process of finding an integral is called integration, which is the reverse operation of differentiation.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus links differentiation and integration, stating that the definite integral of a function over [a, b] can be calculated using its antiderivative as F(b) - F(a).
