Notes
The Roman Empire was founded in 27 BCE when Octavian, later known as Augustus, became the first emperor after the fall of the Roman Republic.

At its peak, the Roman Empire stretched across three continents, encompassing Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, with a population of around 50-60 million.

Latin was the official language of the Roman Empire, and it served as the foundation for many modern languages, including Spanish, French, and Italian.

The Empire was known for its impressive engineering feats, such as aqueducts, roads, bridges, and monumental structures like the Colosseum and the Pantheon.

Roman law and governance were highly influential, forming the basis for many modern legal systems.

The Pax Romana, or "Roman Peace," was a period of relative stability and prosperity that lasted approximately 200 years, from 27 BCE to 180 CE.

Christianity emerged during the Roman Empire and was eventually legalized and later made the state religion by Emperor Constantine in the 4th century CE.

The Roman military was a cornerstone of the Empire's power, with disciplined legions and advanced strategies that allowed for territorial expansion and control.

The Empire was divided into the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire (later known as the Byzantine Empire) in 395 CE due to administrative and cultural differences.

The Western Roman Empire fell in 476 CE when the last emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed, marking the end of ancient Rome and the beginning of the Middle Ages in Europe.
