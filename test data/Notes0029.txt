Inequalities

Notes
Inequalities show a relationship where one value is greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to another value, using symbols like >, <, ≥, and ≤.

If you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you must reverse the inequality sign for it to remain valid.

Inequalities can represent a range of solutions, often expressed as intervals or compound inequalities, such as 2 < x ≤ 5.

Graphical representations of inequalities on a number line use open or closed circles to indicate whether endpoints are included (closed for ≤ or ≥, open for < or >).

Adding or subtracting the same value on both sides of an inequality does not affect the direction of the inequality.
