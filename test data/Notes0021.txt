Notes
A derivative represents the rate of change of a function with respect to one of its variables.

The derivative of a function at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point.

The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation.

The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then the derivative f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).

The product rule is used to differentiate the product of two functions: if u(x) and v(x) are functions, then (uv)' = u'v + uv'.

The quotient rule is used to differentiate the division of two functions: if u(x) and v(x) are functions, then (u/v)' = (u'v - uv') / v^2.

The chain rule is used to differentiate composite functions: if y = f(g(x)), then dy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).

A second derivative represents the rate of change of the first derivative and provides information about the concavity of the function.

Critical points, where the derivative equals zero or is undefined, help identify maximum, minimum, or saddle points of a function.

Derivatives have practical applications in physics, engineering, economics, and other fields for modeling rates of change, optimizing systems, and analyzing motion.
