Notes
The Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) was one of the most influential and enduring dynasties in Chinese history, marking a golden age of culture, economy, and technological advancements.

The dynasty is divided into two periods: the Western Han (206 BCE–9 CE) and the Eastern Han (25–220 CE), separated by the brief Xin Dynasty of Wang Mang.

The Han Dynasty saw the establishment of Confucianism as the official state philosophy, influencing Chinese culture, governance, and education for centuries.

Major achievements during the Han Dynasty included the invention of paper, advancements in medicine, astronomy, and engineering, and the development of the Silk Road for trade.

The dynasty ended after a period of internal strife, corruption, and rebellion, leading to the eventual division of China into the Three Kingdoms period.
