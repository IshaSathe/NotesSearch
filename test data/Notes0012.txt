Buoyancy

Notes
Buoyancy is the upward force exerted by a fluid (liquid or gas) on an object placed in it, counteracting the weight of the object.

Archimedes' principle states that the buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.

An object will float in a fluid if the buoyant force is equal to or greater than its weight; it will sink if the buoyant force is less.

The density of the object relative to the density of the fluid determines whether it will float or sink; objects with lower density than the fluid will float.

Buoyancy plays a key role in designing ships, submarines, hot air balloons, and other objects that need to float or be submerged in a controlled manner.
