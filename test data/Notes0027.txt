Variables

Notes
Variables are symbols, usually letters, that represent unknown or changeable values in algebraic expressions and equations.

A variable can take on different values depending on the context, making it a key tool for generalizing mathematical relationships.

Variables can be combined with constants and other variables using operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to form algebraic expressions.

When solving equations, the goal is often to find the value of a variable that makes the equation true.

Variables are classified as independent or dependent in functions, where the independent variable determines the value of the dependent variable.
