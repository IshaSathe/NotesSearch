Stoichiometry

Notes
Stoichiometry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in a chemical reaction.

It is based on the law of conservation of mass, which states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction, ensuring the mass of reactants equals the mass of products.

Stoichiometry uses mole ratios derived from a balanced chemical equation to calculate the amount of one substance required or produced when another is consumed.

Limiting reactants are identified in stoichiometry to determine the maximum amount of product that can be formed in a reaction.

Stoichiometric calculations often involve conversions between grams, moles, and molecules using molar masses and Avogadro's number.
