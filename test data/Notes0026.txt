Quadrilaterals

Notes
A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides, four vertices, and four angles.

The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360 degrees.

Quadrilaterals can be classified into several types, including squares, rectangles, rhombuses, parallelograms, trapezoids, and kites.

A parallelogram is a quadrilateral where opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.

A rectangle is a type of parallelogram where all angles are 90 degrees.

A square is a special type of rectangle and rhombus where all sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees.

A trapezoid (or trapezium) has at least one pair of parallel sides, which are called the bases.

A rhombus is a parallelogram where all sides are equal in length, and opposite angles are equal.

A kite is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal in length.

The diagonals of a quadrilateral may have special properties depending on the type; for example, in a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, and in a rhombus, they intersect at right angles.
