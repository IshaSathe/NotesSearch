Notes
Geometry proofs are logical arguments that use definitions, theorems, postulates, and previously proven statements to show that a conclusion is true.

Proofs are written in a structured format, often as two-column proofs (statements and reasons) or paragraph proofs, to ensure clarity and logical flow.

Proofs rely on basic geometric principles such as congruence, similarity, parallel lines, and properties of shapes to establish the truth of a statement.

Every proof begins with given information and proceeds through a series of justified steps to reach the conclusion.

Indirect proofs, also known as proofs by contradiction, involve assuming the opposite of the desired conclusion, then showing that this assumption leads to a contradiction.
