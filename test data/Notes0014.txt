Periodic Table

Notes
The periodic table organizes elements based on their atomic number, which is the number of protons in an atom's nucleus.

Elements in the same column (group) have similar chemical properties because they share the same number of valence electrons.

The rows (periods) of the periodic table represent the energy levels of an atomâ€™s electrons, with elements in the same period having electrons in the same principal energy level.

The periodic table is divided into metals, nonmetals, and metalloids based on their physical and chemical properties.

Transition metals, found in the center of the periodic table, often have variable oxidation states and form colored compounds.
