Notes
Grammar is the set of rules that govern the structure of a language, including how words are arranged into sentences.

Sentences are composed of clauses, which are groups of words that contain a subject and a predicate.

Parts of speech include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.

Subject-verb agreement ensures that the verb matches the subject in number (singular or plural) and person.

Tenses in grammar indicate the time of an action or state, such as past, present, or future.

Articles (a, an, the) are used to specify nouns as definite or indefinite.

Pronouns replace nouns to avoid repetition and can be subjective, objective, possessive, or reflexive.

Adjectives describe or modify nouns, while adverbs describe or modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.

Punctuation plays a critical role in grammar by clarifying meaning and separating sentence elements.

Sentence structure is categorized into simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences based on the number and type of clauses.
