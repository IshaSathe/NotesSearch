Evolution 

Notes
Evolution is the process through which species of organisms change over generations through variations in their genetic material.

Natural selection, proposed by Charles Darwin, is a key mechanism of evolution, where individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce.

Mutations in DNA, genetic recombination, and gene flow contribute to the genetic diversity that drives evolutionary changes.

Fossil records, comparative anatomy, and molecular biology provide evidence for the common ancestry of all living organisms.

Evolution does not have a predetermined direction or goal; it is influenced by environmental pressures and random genetic changes.
