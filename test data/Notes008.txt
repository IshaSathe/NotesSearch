Inflation

Notes
Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, causing the purchasing power of money to decrease over time.

It is measured using indexes such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Producer Price Index (PPI).

Moderate inflation is a normal part of a healthy economy, encouraging spending and investment instead of hoarding money.

Hyperinflation occurs when inflation rises uncontrollably and drastically, leading to the collapse of a currencyâ€™s value.

Deflation, the opposite of inflation, occurs when prices decrease over time, often signaling economic trouble.

Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, use monetary policies like adjusting interest rates to control inflation.

Demand-pull inflation happens when demand for goods and services exceeds supply, driving up prices.

Cost-push inflation occurs when the costs of production (like wages or raw materials) increase, leading businesses to raise prices.

Inflation erodes savings and fixed incomes, as the money saved buys less over time.

Governments often set inflation targets (e.g., 2% annually) to balance economic growth with stable prices.
