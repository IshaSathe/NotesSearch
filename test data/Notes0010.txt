DNA

Notes
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecule that carries the genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known living organisms.

DNA is composed of two long strands forming a double helix, with each strand made of repeating units called nucleotides.

Each nucleotide consists of a sugar molecule (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.

The four nitrogenous bases in DNA are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), where A pairs with T and C pairs with G through hydrogen bonds.

DNA is found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells.

DNA replication is the process by which DNA makes a copy of itself during cell division, ensuring genetic information is passed to daughter cells.

Genes are segments of DNA that code for proteins, which are essential for the structure and function of an organism.

Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence that can result in genetic variation, diseases, or evolutionary adaptations.

DNA is compactly organized into chromosomes in the nucleus, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

The entire set of an organism's DNA, including all its genes, is called the genome, and it contains all the information needed to build and maintain that organism.
