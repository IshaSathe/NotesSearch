Notes
A database is an organized collection of data that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of information.

Databases are managed using Database Management Systems (DBMS), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Oracle.

Databases can be classified into different types, including relational, non-relational (NoSQL), hierarchical, and object-oriented databases.

In relational databases, data is stored in tables with rows and columns, and relationships between data are managed using keys (primary and foreign keys).

Databases are designed to ensure data integrity, security, and efficient access through features like transactions, indexing, and access controls.
