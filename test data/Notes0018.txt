Greek Philosophy

Notes
Greek philosophy is the foundation of Western thought, emerging in ancient Greece around the 6th century BCE and focusing on questions about existence, knowledge, ethics, and the nature of reality.

The three most influential Greek philosophers are Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, each of whom developed groundbreaking ideas in ethics, politics, logic, and metaphysics.

Socrates emphasized the importance of questioning and dialogue to discover truth and moral understanding, a method now known as the Socratic method.

Plato, a student of Socrates, founded the Academy and introduced the Theory of Forms, suggesting that non-material abstract forms (ideas) are the truest reality.

Aristotle, a student of Plato, focused on empirical observation and logic, contributing significantly to science, ethics, politics, and the classification of knowledge.
