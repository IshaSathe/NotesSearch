Gravity

Notes
Gravity is a natural force that attracts two objects with mass toward each other.

The strength of gravity depends on the masses of the objects and the distance between them, as described by Newton's law of universal gravitation.

Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental forces of nature but has an infinite range.

The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is approximately 9.8 m/sÂ² near the surface.

Isaac Newton formulated the law of universal gravitation, and Albert Einstein later expanded the understanding of gravity with his general theory of relativity.

Einstein's theory describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy.

Gravity is responsible for keeping planets in orbit around stars, moons around planets, and galaxies together.

Black holes are regions of space with such strong gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape from them.

Weight is the force of gravity acting on an object's mass and varies depending on the strength of the gravitational field.

Microgravity occurs in environments like the International Space Station, where objects experience very weak gravitational forces, creating the sensation of weightlessness.
