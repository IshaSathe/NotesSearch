Notes
Punctuation marks are symbols used in writing to clarify meaning, indicate pauses, and structure sentences.

The period (.) is used to end declarative sentences and some abbreviations.

A comma (,) separates elements in a list, sets off introductory elements, and is used in complex sentences to clarify meaning.

The question mark (?) is used at the end of interrogative sentences to indicate a question.

The exclamation mark (!) conveys strong emotion, emphasis, or surprise.

Quotation marks (" ") enclose direct speech, titles of short works, or words used with specific emphasis.

The apostrophe (') is used to indicate possession or contractions, such as "it's" for "it is" or "John's book."

The semicolon (;) connects closely related independent clauses and can also separate items in a complex list.

The colon (:) introduces lists, explanations, or quotes and can also emphasize a point.

Parentheses ( ) enclose supplementary or explanatory information that is not essential to the main sentence.
