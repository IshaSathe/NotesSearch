Notes
Reference citations are used to give credit to the original sources of information, ideas, or research in a work.

Different citation styles exist, such as APA, MLA, Chicago, and Harvard, each with specific formatting rules.

Citations typically include key information about the source, such as the authorâ€™s name, title, publication date, publisher, and location of the source.

In-text citations provide brief information within the text that corresponds to a full reference in a bibliography or reference list.

Proper citation helps avoid plagiarism, ensures academic integrity, and allows readers to locate and verify the original sources.
