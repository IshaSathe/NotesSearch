Atoms

Notes
Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter, composed of three main subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons.

The nucleus of an atom, located at its center, contains protons and neutrons and holds most of the atom’s mass.

Electrons orbit the nucleus in regions called electron clouds or shells, with their arrangement determining the chemical properties of the atom.

The number of protons in an atom’s nucleus defines its atomic number and determines the element (e.g., hydrogen has 1 proton, oxygen has 8).

Neutrons have no charge and contribute to the atom’s mass, helping to stabilize the nucleus.

Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons, leading to different atomic masses.

Electrons are negatively charged and are involved in chemical bonding and reactions.

Atoms are mostly empty space, with the nucleus being extremely dense and the electrons occupying vast regions around it.

Atoms can combine to form molecules through chemical bonds such as covalent, ionic, or metallic bonds.

The periodic table organizes elements based on their atomic number, grouping atoms with similar properties into families and periods.
