Genes

Notes
Genes are units of heredity made up of DNA that carry instructions for the development, function, and reproduction of living organisms.

Each gene provides the code to produce specific proteins, which perform most of the functions in cells and determine traits.

Humans have approximately 20,000 to 25,000 genes located on 23 pairs of chromosomes in the nucleus of most cells.

Genes can exist in different forms called alleles, which contribute to variations in traits among individuals.

Mutations in genes can lead to changes in protein production, sometimes causing genetic disorders or contributing to the evolution of species.
