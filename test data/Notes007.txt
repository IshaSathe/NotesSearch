Supply & Demand

Notes
Supply and demand are fundamental concepts in economics that determine the price and quantity of goods and services in a market.

Demand refers to the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices.

Supply refers to the quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to offer for sale at various prices.

The law of demand states that as the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded typically increases, and vice versa, assuming other factors are constant.

The law of supply states that as the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied typically increases, and vice versa, assuming other factors are constant.

The equilibrium price is the point where the supply and demand curves intersect, representing the price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded.

A shift in the demand curve occurs when factors such as income, tastes, or the price of related goods change, altering the quantity demanded at every price.

A shift in the supply curve occurs when factors such as production costs, technology, or the number of sellers change, altering the quantity supplied at every price.

Price elasticity measures how sensitive the quantity demanded or supplied is to changes in price; goods with elastic demand or supply experience larger changes in quantity for a given price change.

Market shortages occur when demand exceeds supply at a given price, while surpluses occur when supply exceeds demand. Both situations drive price adjustments toward equilibrium.
