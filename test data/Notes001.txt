Notes
Pottery is one of the oldest human crafts, with evidence of its practice dating back over 10,000 years.

The three main types of pottery are earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain, each differing in composition, firing temperature, and durability.

Clay is the primary material used in pottery and comes in different types, such as kaolin, ball clay, and stoneware clay.

The process of making pottery involves shaping the clay, drying it to remove moisture, and then firing it in a kiln to harden.

Pottery can be shaped by hand (e.g., coiling, pinching), on a potter's wheel, or using molds.

Glazes are applied to pottery to create a smooth, waterproof surface and to add decorative colors and textures.

Pottery kilns are used to fire clay at high temperatures, ranging from 1,000°C to 1,400°C, depending on the type of clay and glaze.

Pottery has been used historically for functional purposes like storing food and water, as well as for artistic and ceremonial purposes.

Famous pottery traditions include Chinese porcelain, Greek amphorae, and Native American pottery.

Contemporary pottery often combines traditional techniques with modern designs, blending art and functionality.
